# This workflow evaluates actions execution time and outputs a job summary.
# It uses the `get_org_workflow_runs` Python script to call the GitHub API and retrieve workflow runs, which are output to runs.json.
# It then evaluates workflow runs statistics using the `evaluate_org_workflow_runs` Python script, and outputs the results to workflow-stats.csv.
# The workflow also generates a table in Markdown format for the report.
# The workflow is triggered by a manual workflow_dispatch event.
#
# Variations:
# - `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` in `step: Set dates` - They are set to one month apart. This can be modified to the desired duration.
# - Template in `step: Generate table diagram in markdown` can be customised with styling.
