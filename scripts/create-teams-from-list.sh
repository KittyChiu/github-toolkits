# DOT NOT REMOVE TRAILING NEW LINE IN THE INPUT CSV FILE

# Need to run this to be able to create teams: gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:org

# Usage: 
# Step 1: Create a list of teams in a csv file, 1 per line, with a trailing empty line at the end of the file
#           - child teams should have a slash in the name, e.g. test1-team/test1-1-team
#           - build out the parent structure in the input file before creating the child teams;
#               e.g. have the 'test1-team' come before 'test1-team/test1-1-team' in the file
# Step 2: ./create-teams-from-list.sh teams.csv <org>

# Example input file:
# 
# test11-team
# test22-team
# test11-team/test11111-team
# test11-team/test11111-team/textxxx-team
