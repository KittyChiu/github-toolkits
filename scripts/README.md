# README

This is a library for sample point-solutions ("How do I") with `gh api`. It is complimenting to @joshjohanning's library at https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts/tree/main/scripts

The scripts are example-only and not production ready. Other operational implementations need to be taken into account prior to production use.

Quick start for `gh api` - https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api
